# R_Project2
Scientific question: How does the 92-bp deletion of the Cytidine monophospho-N-acetylnneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene in humans affect CMAH gene expression, and is the sequence identity any similar than that of mice and chimpanzees who do have expression of CMAH gene?


README files:
Project 2 code draft rmd/html file: very rough draft, still trying to get code to work of my project 2
Mice_CMAH fasta: sequence coding CMAH gene in mice
Humans_CMAH fasta: sequence coding CMAH gene in humans (although nonfunctional due to mutation)
